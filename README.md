Jade
====

Jade is an Alternative Development Environment (IDE) for GemStone/S that runs on Microsoft Windows.

Jade is built in (and inspired by) Dolphin Smalltalk from [Object-Arts](https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin).

### Runtime Installation
To install Jade runtime, download a 25 MB zip file with the executable and supporting libraries from [here](https://github.com/jgfoster/Jade/raw/master/runtime/Jade.zip). Once you have the environment, you can get just the latest executable (about 1.5 MB) from [here](https://github.com/jgfoster/Jade/raw/master/runtime/Jade.exe).

### Development Installation

To install Jade in Dolphin 7, follow these steps:

1. Install a Github client such as [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. Clone https://github.com/dolphinsmalltalk/Dolphin to Documents\Dolphin.
2. Clone https://github.com/jgfoster/Jade to Documents\Dolphin\Jade.
4. Run Documents\Dolphin\Jade\Boot.cmd.
5. Finally, open a login window:
```
    JadeLoginShell show.
```
